Projects Completed Till Now

Machine Learning 
> Supervised Learning
-- Classification

◇ Project 1 - Wine Quality Prediction
-
> This project applies K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression algorithms to classify species in the Iris dataset, demonstrating model setup, evaluation, and performance comparison.
-- Filtered wine quality scores to include values between 3 and 8 and categorized them as 'low,' 'medium,' or 'high.'
> One-hot encoded the quality labels for classification and standardized the features.
> Trained a multinomial Logistic Regression model and evaluated it using a confusion matrix and classification report.
> Trained a Random Forest classifier with class balancing and analyzed feature importance.
> Adjusted thresholds in the Random Forest model to optimize performance.
> Trained an SVM model for classification and plotted ROC curves for each class.
> Compared performance across Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models.
